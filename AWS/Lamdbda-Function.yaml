Lambda Function: 
Solving the below problems
  Compute 
  ServerLess

Lambda Function : will also give compute 
It is server less and can execute the application
it will run automatically with out making the compute services visible to the user

Cost Optimization/Estimation :
  ServerLess --> Cost Optimization
  Security --> Very Important in public cloud
  Compliance --> how secure the appilication .
  
Cloud Cost Optimization:
    If You are not managing the cloud cost doing efficiently

Lambda Function --> EBS Volume SnapShots --> 

Write a lambda Function (Python Code)
This will talk to the AWS API
Fetch all the EBS Snapshots
Filterout SnapShots

What is SnapShots:
  EBS Snapshots are a point-in-time copy of your data, and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts, and improve backup compliance.
